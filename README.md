# UsefulGLua
Useful Garry's Mod Lua functions that myself and others can reference.

Do *NOT* be intimidates by the code in [examples.lua](https://github.com/JoshJOkayguy/UsefulGLua/blob/main/examples.lua). It's very simple so long as you carefully look through it and read the comments! I'll provide an index at the end of the readme if you still find yourself lost so that you can still get help with whatever you need.
